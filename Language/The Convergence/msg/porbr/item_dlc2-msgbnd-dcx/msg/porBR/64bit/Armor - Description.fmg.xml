<text id="99040000">Hood of a deranged hermit who left the main druidic order. The most extreme of the druids believed that to have power over nature, they must become one with nature.

Effect: applies 10 magic damage on roll</text>
<text id="99041000">Living armor that was made by combining animal leathers and still-growing branches.
The thorns of these branches will damage anyone they comes in contact with, and slowly drain their essence.

and by the end, did not care to do so.

Effect: applies 20 magic damage on roll</text>
<text id="99042000">Wrappings of a deranged hermit, coated in numerous stains. Those who forsook modern life to become one with nature skinned their own kills for armor.

Effect: applies 10 magic damage on roll</text>
<text id="99043000">Leg wrappings of a deranged hermit, long-since caked in mud and blood.

Effect: applies 10 magic damage on roll</text>
<text id="99050000">Helm of squires in the lost land of Oolacile. In the land of light sorceries, even their knights were expected to be proficient in magic.

Effect: boosts STR/DEX/INT by 1</text>
<text id="99051000">Armor of squires in the lost land of Oolacile. While not magnificent in appearance, this armor is light and practical, allowing the wearer both mobility and protection.

Effect: boosts STR/DEX/INT by 1</text>

Adds HP and SP regen</text>
<text id="99121000">The metal and cloth of these robes are both adorned with red etchings that seem to pulse like veins.

<text id="99140000">Hooded mask of the Grand Alchemist. The long beak was often filled with dried herbs and flowers, with holes far in the back. This would cover up the stench of chemicals as well as protect the alchemist from breathing in harmful or diseased gasses.

Grand Alchemist is a title used to denote alchemists who have made ground-breaking discoveries. Since alchemy was often poorly understood and ignored, the title was typically either granted from master to journeyman, or simply bestowed upon oneself.
As a result, this title is more for one's pride, as that is the only thing that benefits from having it.

Effect: increases power of all bombs by 1%, item discovery by 25% and increases estus recovery by 50%.</text>
<text id="99141000">Bleached leather coat of the Grand Alchemist. Slightly charred from a plethora of unexpected reactions, this coat is meant to protect the alchemist from the testing of their most hazardous hypotheses.

<text id="99142000">Bleached leather gloves of the Grand Alchemist. Bleaching was a common practice among chirurgeons, as the process prevented leather from absorbing the fluids often excreted by their patients. The same principle applies here, though an alchemist's patients are usually inorganic.

<text id="99143000">Occluded leather boots of the Grand Alchemist. These boots show little sign of the wear of most outfits found in Lothric, as the protection they offer is best suited for specifically controlled environments.

<text id="99160000">The ceremonial attire of a venerated archdruid of the Conclave, now worn but still carefully maintained. 

Caimar’s exodus from Vinheim was abrupt, disillusioned by the grasping and self-serving behavior of his former colleagues.
He had always maintained that the life of a druid was one of action, bold and unapologetic. He saw the members of the Conclave slowly turn away from this attitude and adopt the positions of sedentary academics, like their once bitter enemies at the School of the Dragon, or become political sycophants, groveling at the table of Vinheim’s aristocracy.

Effect: Reduces FP cost of Conjurations by 6%, reduces weapon stamina consumption by 2% and adds 10% max FP.</text>

<text id="99730000">The ruby mask of the Witch Hunters of Londor. The reason for wearing such a mask has been lost, but many rumors surround it.
Some say rubies are able to purify the corruption of the dark, while the more cynical claim it is to appear forever coated in the fresh blood of dark mages.

Effect: boosts STR, INT and FTH by 1</text>
<text id="99731000">Reviled in Londor, this armor was worn by Witch Hunters, who ply their trade throughout Lothric and the lands of the lords.
Working towards the annihilation of dark magic, they themselves relied on such means for this task, and were labeled as hypocrites.

Effect: boosts STR, INT and FTH by 2</text>
<text id="99732000">Long gloves used by the Witch Hunters of Londor. They believed that they could reduce their own corruption by minimizing their contact with the dark.

Effect: boosts STR, INT and FTH by 1</text>
<text id="99733000">The chain skirt and trousers worn often by the Witch Hunters of Londor. Though they hail from the land of hollows, Witch Hunters could be found throughout the world.

<text id="99750000">The ruined blindfold of the once proud Legion of Izalith.
Though the witch’s pyromancies were often too great for mortals to handle - especially men - those who served them would nonetheless seek mastery of demon’s fire.

Effect: increases Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith by 1.</text>
<text id="99751000">Regalia of the Legion of Izalith, fallen to ashen tatters in the wake of Izalith’s destruction.

Effect: increases Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith by 2.</text>
<text id="99752000">Ruined wrappings once worn by the Legion of Izalith.
Supposedly, these wraps were once enchanted so that even Chaos could not burn them away, but so long has it been since Izalith was lost that the magic has faded, offering almost nothing to the wearer but a memory.

Effect: increases Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith by 1.</text>
<text id="99753000">A tattered garment once worn by the Legionnaires of Lost Izalith. The original design was worn by both men and women, emulating the dress of their beloved Witch and her daughters.
The thread was spun from the webs of a demonic spider, and was meant to survive, but did not.

<text id="99760000">Tattered and ragged, the once proud regalia of the Forossan sages serves as temporary attire for aeromancers that seek ascension to the skies.
A knowledge once thought lost, Aeromancies were returned at the advent of the Nameless King’s Forossa.

Effect: reduces cost of sorceries by 2%.</text>
<text id="99761000">Once an ornate robe, the wear of wild wind has left this discarded cloak in tatters. Commonly found among apprentice aeromancers, who seek the path to Forossa, home of the greatest aeromancies.

Effect: reduces cost of sorceries by 4%.</text>
<text id="99762000">To call the remnants of this garment gloves is imaginative, and based largely on their appearance long ago.
Offering little in the way of defense, the torn remnants still contain a fractional power, a useful tool for aspiring aeromancers.

Effect: reduces cost of sorceries by 2%.</text>
<text id="99763000">Adorned in gold leaf, the majority of the waistcloth survived what the rest of the regalia did not.
Forossan dignitaries adorned themselves in gold, the ornate metal a reliable weight for anchoring one against their own wind. As for its conductivity, perhaps that is the reason aeromancers do not fly.

Effect: reduces cost of sorceries by 2%.</text>
<text id="99780000">These masked adornments are worn by geomancers who have abandoned the fading flame.
Set apart from the others on the path of chaos and fire, these geomancers have found kinship with the earth. Dusty and worn, they resemble little more than the rags of a mad hermit, perhaps one that has found kinship with demonkind.

Effect: reduces cost of conjurations by 2%</text>
<text id="99781000">Tattered shawl of those who harnessed the power of earth.
Geomancers tied themselves to the fate of demons, and sacrificed their connection to the flame with one of stone and earth. By infusing the ground with just a flickering ember, it answers their call. Dusty and worn, these garments have seen much of the earth, but lack greater protection.

Effect: reduces cost of conjurations by 4%</text>
<text id="99782000">Tattered cloth gloves worn by geomancers.
Constant use of geomancy has an affect not just on oneself, but on the clothes they wear. Unfettered use of a geomancer’s tool to call upon the earth has caused rock to sprout, as if alive, along the left hand. This stone slightly increases protection, and reduces the strain of controlling the earth.

Effect: reduces cost of conjurations by 2%</text>
<text id="99783000">A tattered cloth, covered in the dust of worked stone.
The boots of such a piece were once furred, but have since become as solid as marble, and taken on a similar color. Novice geomancers covered their bodies completely, as earth is volatile, and the dust they were exposed to could tear their lungs apart.
