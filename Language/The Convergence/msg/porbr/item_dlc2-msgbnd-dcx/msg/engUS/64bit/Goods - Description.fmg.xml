<text id="270">Red moss clump used as maggot repellent.

blades or spikes, and once triggered causes
severe damage. Use this moss clump before
it reaches that point.</text>
<text id="271">Medicinal purple moss clump.
Reduces poison build-up. Cures poison.

Poison builds up in the body, and when it
breaks out, it causes gradual damage over
a period of time.

Poison can be exasperating, so be sure to carry sufficient moss clumps when traveling to a blighted area.</text>
<text id="272">Potently medicinal moss clump with a flower.
Reduces poison and toxin. Cures ailments.

A toxin is a more vicious form of poison which

Cures poison and restores HP.

Many such charms were blessed in
reconstructed ancient ceremonies, carried out

an imitation can be quite enough.</text>

<text id="293">Dried fecal waste material, moist on the inside.

Throw at enemy to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Though the stench makes it difficult to carry on one's person, inflicting toxins on an enemy yields high damage over time. Perhaps some Undead have fond memories of waste. Or, perhaps not.</text>
<text id="294">A skull resplendent in the scent of souls. Prepared by evangelists of the Cathedral of the Deep.

<text id="300">Dragon-hunting tool used by Lothric knights.

Has high luck scaling.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons,

This explains their special hunting gear, and why
they worshipped the sun.</text>
<text id="301">An urn filled with crystal-clear water.
Originally intended as a soothing potion,
this water scalds the skin of Undead and Hollows.

In the old capital of Mirrah, an ancient,

ever since Mirrah became embroiled in war.</text>
<text id="302">Black bisque urn attached to a string and filled

<text id="303">Dried fecal waste material, marked by a long
plant stalk that was not properly digested.

Throw behind at enemies to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Strictly speaking, this consists of different
material than the dung pie, but waste is waste,
no sense in splitting hairs.</text>
<text id="304">Tool used in duels of judgment. Nulls effects

<text id="313">A sectioned throwing knife inscribed with runes.
Throw at enemies to inflict magic damage.

<text id="314">A throwing knife steeped in the dredges of humanity.
Throw at enemies to inflict dark damage.

Once sacramental daggers, these knives have become twisted by the dark of Aldrich and his followers.
As dreams of the great sea plagued the church, these daggers were once used to cleanse. Such a task is beyond them now.</text>
<text id="316">A throwing dagger made to look like holy swords.
Throw at enemies to inflict lightning damage.

Strange in their design, the clerics of the old gods cared more for ornamentation than for use.

Euclus had once been heralded as a great and benevolent ruler. A master of light sorcery, he was wholly committed to the pact made with the old lords of Lordran and to the renewal of the age of fire.
After the great fall of his homeland, his soul, like the souls of thousands of others, was lost to the abyssal incursion into which the great city sank.
Reborn with the great convergence of land and time, he was drawn as a hollow to the source of light’s power. He mindlessly protected Filianore’s seat, wielding the full power of light sorcery.</text>

<text id="2123">Cinders of a lord left by the Abyss Watchers.

If the lords will not return to their thrones
themselves, let them return as cinders.

The Watchers of the Abyss swore upon their
shared wolf's blood, which also served as their
mandate as lords.</text>
<text id="2124">Cinders of a lord left by Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.

If the lords will not return to their thrones
themselves, let them return as cinders.

Aldrich became a lord by devouring men,
but was disillusioned with his throne, and so took
to devouring gods instead.</text>
<text id="2125">Cinders of a lord left by Yhorm the Giant.

If the lords will not return to their thrones
themselves, let them return as cinders.

Lonely Yhorm became a Lord of Cinder to put the Profaned Flame to rest, knowing full well that those who spoke of him as lord were quite insincere.</text>
<text id="2126">Cinders of a lord left by Prince Lothric.

If the lords will not return to their thrones
themselves, let them return as cinders.

The Lothric bloodline was obsessed with creating a worthy heir, and when this proved impossible, resorted to unspeakable means. Suffice it to say, the path to linking the fire is a cursed one indeed.</text>

Give to the old master pyromancer to learn chaos pyromancies of Izalith.

Chaos pyromancies manipulate lava, and birthed all later forms of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="2130">A tome falsely attributed Quelana, the last Witch of Izalith.
This tome was scribed by sages of the demonic arts, who sought to infuse their flame with the earth below for greater destructive potential.
Such magicks are only teachable by a true demon, leaving many who seek such knowledge disappointed.</text>
<text id="2131">The source of the first cryomancies is often debated by those who know of such things.
Some claim they originate in the old kingdom of Ivory, a defense against the flames of Chaos.
Others insist that the inversion of fire comes from the Painted World. No matter the truth, this tome was taught in Carthus because of its association with the dark.</text>
<text id="2132">Scroll containing sorceries of the Crystal Sages.

Give to a sorcerer to learn sorceries of the Sages.

As any sorcerer knows, sorcery is a talent, and these sorceries were refined to nurture a very special talent.</text>

"Come to the mausoleum in Farron. Only one can take the path of ancient dragons."</text>
<text id="2143">Undead bones that yet burn.

Cast it into the shrine bonfire to boost the recovery provided by the Estus Flask.

The bonfire's cinders are the bones of Undead, and a bone that still burns is a fresh cinder indeed. Before feeding upon death, one must first pray to it.</text>
<text id="2144">Rosaria was careful to appease Aldrich, but Sulyvahn was not so easily fooled.
Though the secrets of Rosaria's Lifeblooded guardians were beyond his comprehension, there was an understanding among their order: those who ventured to Irythill should not expect to return alive.
Rosaria still keeps a finger of each, in memory of their service and sacrifice.</text>
<text id="2145">Rosaria's Blood Knights were sometimes tasked with seeking new blood.
In the hidden alleys of Lordran, they searched for potential guardians and hunters who would serve their mistress of blood.
To defend themselves from attack, Rosaria granted them greater knowledge of her own magic, and granted them a fitting name: Vampires.</text>
<text id="2146">Unclean umbral ash coated with excrement.
Perhaps it's possible the handmaid of Firelink Shrine could turn this into a few new things...

"Oh to savor the sweet pungency but once more..."</text>
<text id="2147">Umbral ash of the prisoner chief of the catacombs.
With this, the shrine handmaid will prepare new items.

They were called xanthous scholars, but some foolishly imitate them by simply dressing in yellow.</text>
<text id="2149">Umbral ash of an Alchemist who believed in the power of science. With this, the shrine handmaid will prepare new items.

It takes but a brief glance at this thing to easily envision Grand Archives, the place where alchemy crafting was started.</text>
<text id="2150">Umbral ash of Unbreakable Patches. With this, the shrine handmaid will prepare new items.

Patches never lost heart, and never looked back. He marched in one direction, and that direction was dead ahead. Did you see him passing by?</text>
<text id="2151">Umbral ash of the fallen warrior who chose the path of the ancient dragons. With this, the shrine handmaid will prepare new items.

Whatever it is, it is sure to grant strength to the most unrelenting warriors.</text>
<text id="2152">Umbral ash of an armor merchant from an eastern land. Surely the handmaid of Firelink Shrine can turn this into a few new things.

<text id="2173">The instability of fusing the old flames of Chaos with the traditions of Geomancy was considered forbidden by many, as it corrupted the earth itself.
This tome was scribed by the Inheritors of the Great Swamp, who sought an easy test for those who wished to join their ranks.
Only those who could wield the stifled flame were admitted as fellow Inheritors.</text>
<text id="2174">A tattered page of a tome of dark sorceries. Once a part of a full tome, the hex masters of old abandoned their ways long before the Lords of Cinder took their thrones.
Hex magic was once a font of power, but grew weaker as it heavily relied on both faith and knowledge to perfect. Why, then, can such mastery of dark be found here?</text>
<text id="2175">The murkmen's souls were often used as research by scholars of dark magic.
Such research was thought lost to time, but such a tome had managed to find its way into the hands of a Carthus Bloodmage.
Foolish was their attempt to combine powers of faith and dark, and they ended up consumed by their own greed. Perhaps this is why hexes were lost?</text>
<text id="2176">The first human to become corrupted by the Abyss, Manus was an unparalleled being.
Even in death, his true soul became shards of the Abyss, which would cause destruction in lands throughout the ages.
Though the magic granted by this tome pales in comparison, those who wish to master hexes would be wise to learn such facsimiles of power.</text>
<text id="2177">Miracles are derived from stories, and stories of the most righteous tend to grant the most powerful.
This tome accompanied its owner, a priestess, to Lothric Castle, where she was instructed to teach the princes such tales.
As time passed, so to did she, but Lothric held such stories close, and used their power to save his brother countless times.</text>
<text id="2178">The lightning miracles of Lothric are imitations of the ones used long ago by the Lord of Sunlight and his men.
Offering phenomenal strength against dragons and their kin, miracles of lightning tell the tale of how humanity triumphed,
and brought forth the Age of Fire, only to find itself with an even greater threat.</text>
<text id="2179">A tome of cryomancies of the Painted World. The chilling cold of this inverted flame is untouched by dark, and a true form of ice magic.
Within the Painted World, there is only ice and snow, and so the denizens therein took that power as their own.
The first Crossbreed was the first master of these cryomancies, and taught them to all who wished to learn.</text>
<text id="2180">The greatest blood mage, Rosaria, reserved the teachings of such divine blood magic for only her most faithful.
They knew the truth of these visceral spells. Blood magic was designed to protect Rosaria and her faithful from Aldrich's hunger and Sulyvahn's greed.
Known as Blood Knights, Rosaria's blood mages were eternally loyal, and cared for her greatly.</text>
<text id="2181">A scroll of aeromancies, developed by the Nameless King.
Unable to stand the atrocities committed against the dragons, he was banished by the Lord of Sunlight, and developed the land of Forossa as a war god.
Based on the power of the sky, this basic scroll of aeromantic sorcery was taught to scholarly disciples who followed him in exile.</text>
<text id="2182">A torn and tattered storybook, abandoned by its owners.
Aldrich's own were once truly devout priests, but those who did not succumb to the corruption of the dark were disposed of.
The miracles within are reminiscent of their lost path, and it is only through negligence that this tome has survived.</text>
<text id="2183">A tome of basic geomancies. Followers of demons found themselves cut from the source of all fire, just as their masters did.
Without such a power, a new school of magic was developed, infusing the lingering flames of pyromancy with the earth below.
Students of such a path rip the ground asunder with their might, arguably causing more destruction than fire ever could.</text>
<text id="2184">Sorceries of light developed in the land of Oolacile.
Masters of deception, sorcerers in this ancient kingdom could bend light into illusions, or render themselves and their gear invisible.
Using light for offense was more difficult, but as the Abyss' power grew, they had no choice but to seek such a path.</text>
<text id="2185">The personal scroll of sorceries, developed by Dusk, princess of the land of Oolacile.
Her magical power was greater than most, and the purity associated with being a maiden could be found in stories told throughout the land.
She survived the loss of her home, but as to where she ended up, none can say.</text>
<text id="2186">A scroll of advanced aeromancies, developed by the followers of Faraam.
To control the tempest is no easy task, but it was necessary for Forossa to survive atop the storm-swept peaks.
No master of magic, the Nameless King allowed his greatest sorcerers to develop such sorceries further.</text>
<text id="2187">A tome created by the druids, a group of mages from Vinheim who developed a branch of magic viewed by many as heretical.
These spells, basic in their design, allow new druidic initiates to call forth lesser creatures, as well as begin to effect a new kind of energy: the essence of life itself.</text>
<text id="2188">This magic tome contains the secrets of greater heretical magic, allowing the manipulation of water, as well as further essence manipulation.
The druids of Vinheim did not practice sorcery, and though they themselves were respected for their power, their power was not.
It is no surprise, then, that they branched out beyond their home."</text>
<text id="2189">Containing the most advanced druidic teachings, this tome's secret can only be learned from a high druid. Such masters of druidic magic were sought by those who wished to use its power to corrupt.
Resistant to the end, such druids would not yield to any tyrant. By their sacrifice, nature endured, until the cinders went unclaimed and distorted the world.</text>
<text id="2190">In a far land, four sisters once sung to the souls of the dead. In the absence of their lord, this was treated as a final rest.
It is from the power of their songs that the lost magic of Nito was replicated. Though no longer melodic, these spells use of an implement allows for more direct control.</text>
<text id="2191">Kept by the Gravetenders of Carthus, this tome contains the necromancies necessary to quell the undead within.
In the absence of Gravelord Nito, necromancers found a place as wardens for catacombs and crypts.
Though they could not grant true death, their power was often enough to protect the living from their wrath.</text>
<text id="2192">The greatest of necromancers touched the realm of the dead, and were forever changed.
Servants of the Pontiff desired such a power, so that they and their master could transcend death.
Unfortunately, even in the ascendant forms such power granted, death was still a possibility, and so, such secrets were discarded as rubbish.</text>
<text id="2200">Use to unsummon creatures called forth by Necromancy and Druidism.

This crystal bears striking resemblance to the Black Separation Crystal, though it has no effect on sentient undead. This crystal severs the ties connecting a summoner to its minion, banshing it from the master’s side. Creature’s affected by such a crystal bear no ill will to their masters, for if they did, the summoning arts would have faded as quickly as they began.
</text>
<text id="2300">A searing hot crystal, carved from the sap of a Great Archtree.

Lasts until warp or death, canceled by using Lock of the Crossbreed.</text>

<text id="2901000">Summon a small, venomous rat as your minion. Natural minions are a staple of druidic magic, calling upon creatures bonded to the user through a connection of life essence.

<text id="2909000">The magic of the Druidic Conclave of Vinheim is a unification of academia and knowledge of the natural world. Rather than relying on the power of souls, or the studied manipulation of energies, a druid’s magic manipulates the power of all living things, called life essence.

Fire a small, magical projectile at enemies from long range, dealing damage and draining HP for a short duration.</text>
<text id="2910000">Once a small clandestine order, the Conclave grew after the sorcerers of Vinheim began to enact laws that allowed for practices once thought to be heretical. As such, the names many of the early innovators in druidic magic have been lost.

Fire a spear of life essence and deals magic damage and drains HP over a short duration.</text>
<text id="2911000">Druids must utilize a combination of intuition and practical knowledge to manipulate the natural world. This skill cannot be taught in a traditional way and depended on the innate ability of the practitioner, much to the chagrin of the elders of the Dragon School.

Fire a small water projectile at enemies that deals damage.
Hold to fire at a continuous rate.</text>
<text id="2912000">A basic manipulation of life essence, allowing the caster to regenerate wounds at an accelerated rate.

Restores HP and SP slowly for 120 seconds.

Life essence is not the power of souls, and does not interact with them in any known way. Alchemists who have seen druidic power would liken it to the ability to control the body directly, and, like medicine, it can become deadly when used wrong.</text>
<text id="2913000">Originally employed as forest camouflage, this spell has been weaponized with the intention of keeping enemies at arm’s length.

Cover your body with sharp limbs and thorns, raising defenses and dealing damage to any enemy nearby when you roll.
Lasts for 60 seconds.

Giving oneself completely to the flow of life essence, an act commonly referred to as “becoming one with nature,” is a dangerous process. Humans, with their inherent darkness, are foreign to the natural world, but to give up one’s darkness is to give up one’s humanity, and lose one’s self completely.</text>
<text id="2914000">Druids enjoy a kinship with the natural world, including the more vicious aspects of nature.

Invoke the fury of a wild beast, increasing damage and defense for you and any nearby summon for a short time.

Release several orbs of essence that seek enemies and drain HP upon impact.</text>
<text id="2923000">While many druids make use of crystallized life essence, Caimar was able to weaponize the crystallization process itself with this conjuration.

Send life essence into the ground around you, causing crystals to violently erupt, dealing damage to enemies.</text>
<text id="2924000">Druids found that the same principles of conjuration that affected life essence could be applied to water as well, the source of all life. When properly manipulated it can be used to devastating effect in combat.

surrounding the goddess Caitha, of whom
Morne was a known follower.</text>
<text id="3510000">This miracle is the tale of how Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, first recruited Gough into the ranks of his most loyal knights.
The giant archer would receive the title of Hawkeye, and even though he was blind, his arrows would always fly true.
The power of this story is said to come from Gough's unending devotion to his lord.

Channel divine energy into a malleable bow of solid lightning. Drawing back the string creates a large spear of arcing electricity, which acts as the arrow.
Once it strikes a target, the lightning splits, and continues to damage adjacent enemies.</text>
<text id="3511000">The purest form of the lightning arrow miracle, practiced by female knights in the great dragon war. Using all the range and accuracy of a traditional lightning arrow, this miracle unleashes the power of sunlight from a great distance.

Fire a sunlight arrow at enemies that calls down a lightning storm on impact.</text>
<text id="3513000">A micracle that causes distress only to those that have turned hollow.

To hollows, there is no greater affliction than the temptation of death. To them, this agony transcends imagination.</text>
<text id="3520000">Miracle taught by Morne, the Archbishop's apostle.

Grants one chance to endure when HP reaches 0

Intended to grant the dying a few moments
for a final farewell. Tears are shed for the sake
of the living, more so than the deceased.</text>
<text id="3521000">Miracle taught to traveling clerics.
Returns caster to the last bonfire used for resting, 
or to the bonfire in the shrine.

It would normally link to one's homeland,
only the curse of the Undead has twisted
its power, redirecting casters to a bonfire.
Perhaps for Undead, the bonfire serves as home.</text>
<text id="3530000">An elementary miracle among clerics, this story of momentary protection can be found in any age.
Creates a shockwave of force.

While it inflicts no direct damage, this miracle propels foes back, staggering them.
Can also defend against incoming arrows.</text>
<text id="3531000">Primal form of Force.
Creates a powerful shockwave.

Wrath of the Gods is an epic tale, while Force is but a woefully incomplete version of that yarn.

This primal account of profound fury
emits a shockwave that also inflicts damage.</text>
<text id="3532000">Traditional miracle of Catarina.
Releases a shockwave in front.

The people of lands known for festivity and drink
are typically outspoken. One can be sure that they
will not bottle their emotions, instead venting
anger and the like with confidence.</text>
<text id="3540000">Miracle of stray souls.
Displays more help from other worlds

<text id="3554000">A bloody miracle taught by Rosaria in the Cathedral of the Deep.

Summons a large swarm of insects to feast on foes, inflicting damage and bleed.

These insects, which lurk in the deep, have tiny jaws lined with fangs to tear open the skin and burrow into the flesh in the blink of an eye, causing intense bleeding.
