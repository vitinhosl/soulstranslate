<text id="2901000">Summon a small, venomous rat as your minion. Natural minions are a staple of druidic magic, calling upon creatures bonded to the user through a connection of life essence. As nature grew twisted, so too did the summons of the druids, until, eventually, life essence could no longer form a link between such terrible beasts.

<text id="2909000">The magic of the Druidic Conclave of Vinheim is a unification of academia and knowledge of the natural world. Rather than relying on the power of souls, or the studied manipulation of energies, a druid’s magic manipulates the power of all living things, called life essence.

Fire a small, magical projectile at enemies from long range, dealing damage and draining HP for a short duration.</text>
<text id="2910000">Once a small clandestine order, the Conclave grew after the sorcerers of Vinheim began to enact laws that allowed for practices once thought to be heretical. As such, the names many of the early innovators in druidic magic have been lost.

Fire a spear of life essence and deals magic damage and drains HP over a short duration.</text>
<text id="2911000">Druids must utilize a combination of intuition and practical knowledge to manipulate the natural world. This skill cannot be taught in a traditional way and depended on the innate ability of the practitioner, much to the chagrin of the elders of the Dragon School.

Fire a small water projectile at enemies that deals damage.
Hold to fire at a continuous rate.</text>
<text id="2912000">A basic manipulation of life essence, allowing the caster to regenerate wounds at an accelerated rate.

Restores HP and SP slowly for 120 seconds.

Life essence is not the power of souls, and does not interact with them in any known way. Alchemists who have seen druidic power would liken it to the ability to control the body directly, and, like medicine, it can become deadly when used wrong.</text>
<text id="2913000">Originally employed as forest camouflage, this spell has been weaponized with the intention of keeping enemies at arm’s length.

Cover your body with sharp limbs and thorns, raising defenses and dealing damage to any enemy nearby when you roll.
Lasts for 60 seconds.

Giving oneself completely to the flow of life essence, an act commonly referred to as “becoming one with nature,” is a dangerous process. Humans, with their inherent darkness, are foreign to the natural world, but to give up one’s darkness is to give up one’s humanity, and lose one’s self completely.</text>
<text id="2914000">Druids enjoy a kinship with the natural world, including the more vicious aspects of nature.

Invoke the fury of a wild beast, increasing damage and defense for you and any nearby summon for a short time.

<text id="2922000">A conjuration unique to Caimar the wanderer. While seeking the spirit-trees of the world, Caimar made many discoveries which he never shared with the Conclave.

Release several orbs of essence that seek enemies and drain HP upon impact.</text>
<text id="2923000">While many druids make use of crystallized life essence, Caimar was able to weaponize the crystallization process itself with this conjuration.

Send life essence into the ground around you, causing crystals to violently erupt, dealing damage to enemies.</text>
<text id="2924000">Druids found that the same principles of conjuration that affected life essence could be applied to water as well, the source of all life. When properly manipulated it can be used to devastating effect in combat.

surrounding the goddess Caitha, of whom
Morne was a known follower.</text>
<text id="3510000">This miracle is the tale of how Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, first recruited Gough into the ranks of his most loyal knights.
The giant archer would receive the title of Hawkeye, and even though he was blind, his arrows would always fly true.
The power of this story is said to come from Gough's unending devotion to his lord.

Channel divine energy into a malleable bow of solid lightning. Drawing back the string creates a large spear of arcing electricity, which acts as the arrow.
Once it strikes a target, the lightning splits, and continues to damage adjacent enemies.</text>
<text id="3511000">The purest form of the lightning arrow miracle, practiced by female knights in the great dragon war. Using all the range and accuracy of a traditional lightning arrow, this miracle unleashes the power of sunlight from a great distance.

Fire a sunlight arrow at enemies that calls down a lightning storm on impact.</text>
<text id="3513000">A micracle that causes distress only to those that have turned hollow.

To hollows, there is no greater affliction than the temptation of death. To them, this agony transcends imagination.</text>
<text id="3520000">Miracle taught by Morne, the Archbishop's apostle.

Grants one chance to endure when HP reaches 0

Intended to grant the dying a few moments
for a final farewell. Tears are shed for the sake
of the living, more so than the deceased.</text>
<text id="3521000">Miracle taught to traveling clerics.
Returns caster to the last bonfire used for resting, 
or to the bonfire in the shrine.

It would normally link to one's homeland,
only the curse of the Undead has twisted
its power, redirecting casters to a bonfire.
Perhaps for Undead, the bonfire serves as home.</text>
<text id="3530000">An elementary miracle among clerics, this story of momentary protection can be found in any age.
Creates a shockwave of force.

While it inflicts no direct damage, this miracle propels foes back, staggering them.
Can also defend against incoming arrows.</text>
<text id="3531000">Primal form of Force.
Creates a powerful shockwave.

Wrath of the Gods is an epic tale, while Force is but a woefully incomplete version of that yarn.

This primal account of profound fury
emits a shockwave that also inflicts damage.</text>
<text id="3532000">Traditional miracle of Catarina.
Releases a shockwave in front.

The people of lands known for festivity and drink
are typically outspoken. One can be sure that they
will not bottle their emotions, instead venting
anger and the like with confidence.</text>
<text id="3540000">Miracle of stray souls.
Displays more help from other worlds

This miracle is likely a tale of their bond.</text>
<text id="3554000">A bloody miracle taught by Rosaria in the Cathedral of the Deep.

Summons a large swarm of insects to feast on foes, inflicting damage and bleed.

These insects, which lurk in the deep, have tiny jaws lined with fangs to tear open the skin and burrow into the flesh in the blink of an eye, causing intense bleeding.
It is no wonder that both priests of the deep and those bound to blood find kinship in such creatures, though for different reasons.
</text>
<text id="3555000">Miracle of Dorhys the deranged evangelist.

Greatly increases magic damage absorption by covering the body in a strong white protective coating.
