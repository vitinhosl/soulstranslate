<text id="1160000">Spellwoven dagger of the legendary Forossan northwarder Odessa. After Forossa crumbled, Odessa followed the Ivory King to Eleum Loyce becoming his most trusted sage. 

As the kingdom fell to ruin, she abided her king to the end, ultimately leaping alongside him into the depths of the old chaos. The blade now hums with both frost and fire. 

Effect: Falling frost matches the wielder’s blows. Also replaces dodge with Hunter Dash if enabled at Benjin. Disabled if current equipment load is above 70% of max.
 
Skill: Endless Winter
Assume the stance of the northwarders. Use normal attack to summon the piercing winds of Eleum Loyce, strong attack to call forth the Ivory King’s blade perverted by frostfire, or left attack to unleash an onslaught of soul spears.</text>
