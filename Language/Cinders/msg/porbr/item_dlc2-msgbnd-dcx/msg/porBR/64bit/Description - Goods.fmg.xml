<text id="270">Red moss clump used as maggot repellent.

blades or spikes, and once triggered causes
severe damage. Use this moss clump before
it reaches that point.</text>
<text id="271">Medicinal purple moss clump.
Reduces poison build-up. Cures poison.

Poison builds up in the body, and when it
breaks out, it causes gradual damage over
a period of time.

Poison can be exasperating, so be sure to carry sufficient moss clumps when traveling to a blighted area.</text>
<text id="272">Potently medicinal moss clump with a flower.
Reduces poison and toxin. Cures ailments.

A toxin is a more vicious form of poison which

<text id="276">Moss clump radiating gentle heat and light.

Weapons imbued with frost are a rare thing indeed, most of them originating in the Boreal Valley.</text>
<text id="277">A blessed charm.
Cures poison and restores HP.

Many such charms were blessed in
reconstructed ancient ceremonies, carried out
in the monastery of Lindelt, now known as

an imitation can be quite enough.</text>

<text id="293">Dried fecal waste material, moist on the inside.

Throw at enemy to inflict 65 Toxic against them and 55 yourself.
Does not scale with any stat.

Though the stench makes it difficult to carry on one's person, inflicting toxins on an enemy yields high damage over time. Perhaps some Undead have fond memories of waste. Or, perhaps not.</text>
<text id="294">A skull resplendent in the scent of souls. Prepared by evangelists of the Cathedral of the Deep.

Throw to shatter, spreading souls which attract enemies. Not effective for all foes.</text>
<text id="295">%null%</text>
<text id="296">Tool used to hunt down the Undead.
Blocks Estus recovery and reduces any form of healing to zero within a limited area for 25 seconds.

No different to a firebomb, save for
the direction in which it is thrown. Enables
a different fighting style, and flexibility in
adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="300">Dragon-hunting tool used by Lothric knights.
Explodes upon contact, inflicting 300 lightning damage.
Scales with Luck.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons,
but were once hunters of dragons themselves.

This explains their special hunting gear, and why
they worshipped the sun.</text>
<text id="301">An urn filled with crystal-clear water.
Originally intended as a soothing potion,
this water scalds the skin of Undead and Hollows.

In the old capital of Mirrah, an ancient,
well-protected spring produces holy water,
but the water has been difficult to acquire
ever since Mirrah became embroiled in war.</text>
<text id="302">Black bisque urn attached to a string and filled

<text id="303">Dried fecal waste material, marked by a long
plant stalk that was not properly digested.

Throw behind at enemies to inflict 65 Toxic against them and 55 yourself.
Does not scale with any stat.

Strictly speaking, this consists of different material than the dung pie, but waste is waste, no sense in splitting hairs.</text>
<text id="304">Tool used in duels of judgment. Nulls effects
of special area effects and prevents spell casting for 20 seconds.

Allfather Lloyd's knights lived in fear of his duels of judgment, in which verdicts were carried out by his Sword of Law.</text>

<text id="2064">My king, 

I have done as you asked. The pontiff allowed us entry into this forlorn place, our prison, and already the knights have begun to turn. Their minds become twisted and their features unrecognizable. I too can feel it gnawing.

The pontiff lent us his outriders that they may be our jailers. I fear though that they may be less human than us. If they can't protect the world from what we will become, the crystal may be our last hope. 

I know not how this letter may reach you, or if yet you still live, but know that I did all I could. Please, my king, don't let our city crumble. 

Give my love to Aava.
